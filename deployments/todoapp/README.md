# Example App with NodeJS

Example application to illustrate different CI/CD integrations with the Napptive Platform.

Visit the [documentation](https://github.com/napptive/example-app-nodejs) for more information.

## Endpoints

The following REST endpoints are provided:

```bash
GET /healthz
GET /todos
POST /todos/add?item=<text>
POST /todos/done?id=<item_identifier>
POST /todos/remove?id=<item_identifier>
```

The /healthz endpoint returns 200 OK on every call, and can be used to illustrate how to set up status monitoring hooks. The other endpoints provide a list of all items (`/todos`), an endpoint to add a new item (`/todos/add`), another to mark an item as done (`/todos/done`), and finally, an endpoint to remove a single item from the list (`/todos/remove`).
